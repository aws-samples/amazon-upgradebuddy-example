      ### Client Engineering has identified an issue with macOS Ventura that requires your attention.

      #### If you do not use SSH/GIT you can ignore this message and click _Acknowledge_.

      Due to changes to the openssh client in macOS Ventura, you will need to regenerate your ssh keys:
      1. Backup your current keys:
          * `mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_bak;`
          * `mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub_bak`
      2. Generate a new key:
          * `ssh-keygen -t ecdsa`
          * Run `mwinit -k ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub` to sign your new key
      3. Test ssh-ing into your hosts
      4. If all works as expected, you can run `rm -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa*`

      #### For more info, including other known issues, please visit the [macOS Ventura wiki page](https://Your Wiki Source/macOS/13.0/#HKnownIssues)!

      Thanks!

      WAT! You're in the future m8!

      macOS Sonoma is not available outside of Mac Beta Testers approved by Client Engineering. If you are not part of this group, you are in an *unsupported* state!!

      If you run into any issues, you will need to wipe and re-provision.

      ### Client Engineering has identified changes to macOS worth noting
      #### Click to Show Desktop
      The default behavior has been changed to show the desktop and clear your windows if you click on the desktop. This can be changed under System Settings > Desktop & Dock > Desktop & Stage Manager

      #### Screen Sharing Menu Bar Icon
      Sonoma includes a new screen sharing API that has a new Menu bar widget, it shows applications using screen sharing and cameras. If you use DisplayLink Manager you will see it listed as capturing your screen, this is expected behavior due to how DisplayLink works. Bartender 4/5 also has a feature that will trigger this to show periodically. This menu bar also includes controls for the new "Reactions" when your camera is activated.

      #### Aerial Wallpapers
      These are quite large 300-500 MB each and they are downloaded on-demand. Because they come from an .apple.com domain they may be throttled in Amazon buildings to prevent saturating the network causing long download times. It is recommended to set them up when off the corp network.
